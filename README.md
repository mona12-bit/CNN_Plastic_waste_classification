To develop a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify plastic waste into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. By automating waste segregation, the model aims to support efficient recycling and sustainable waste management practices.

The dataset, Waste Classification Data, consists of over 25,000 labeled images and serves as the foundation for training and testing the model. The project is designed to explore how deep learning and IoT can be integrated to address the growing issue of plastic pollution.

Future plans include expanding waste categories, deploying the model as a real-time application, and integrating it with IoT-enabled waste management systems.
